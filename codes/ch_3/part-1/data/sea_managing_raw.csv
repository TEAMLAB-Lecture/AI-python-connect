Enzymatically treated alginate is predicted to cause less fouling on both membranes within the pH range of approximately 3.0 to approximately 10.0. Without the presence of calcium cation, alginate lyase reduced the foulant resistance by more than 82% for both membranes. In the presence of 1 mM calcium cation, alginate lyase reduced the foulant resistance by more than 55%. In addition, the foulant structure composed of enzymatically treated alginate was more readily removed by backwashing, suggesting reversible fouling. The advantages of using enzymatic technique to control membrane fouling include high efficiency and no damage to the membrane materials.","1.

US,US,P,A1,SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT,"Waste water conditioning has nearly 150 years of history. During this time, a method has developed that is considered to be state of the art. While this method meets the requirements at hand, it is complicated and expensive. The novel method breaks down the rigidly entrenched method and simplifies it. In a plurality of stages, the only energy that is used is gravity, which is readily available and free of cost. Thus, an “alternative sewage treatment plant” has been developed, which has a simpler method and is less expensive in terms of investment costs and operating costs, at the same capacity, and requires only a fraction of the previous required surface area. The most important characteristic of the invention is that the novel method separates solids from waste water immediately after entering the sewage treatment plant. Mechanically purified water is much faster, easier and less expensive to purify. The paths pursued for conditioning of the sludge are also new. The sludge is regarded as an energy source or recyclable material, which should be utilized accordingly.

US,US,P,B1,Industrial waste water treatment process,"A process for the treatment of industrial waste water. The process includes the steps of admixing partially-treated waste water containing precipitated impurities with a flocculating agent in a flocculation basin, directing the admixed waste water to an elongated sedimentation basin, allowing flocculated solids in the waste water to settle to the bottom of the sedimentation basin, removing the settled solids from the bottom of the sedimentation basin and directing the treated water from the sedimentation basin. The process can further include the step of adjusting the pH of the waste water to precipitate impurities in the waste water prior to the addition of the flocculation agent. The elongated sedimentation basin can include a pair of sloped sides to consolidate the settled solids at the bottom of the basin. The settled solids can then be removed by suction. The basins can be formed from the excavation or impoundment of earth in an area adjacent to a waste water-generating facility. Furthermore, the flow of the streams between basins can be controlled by overflow, with flow rates further controlled by recycle of solids and treated water. The treatment of industrial water according to the present processes allows removal of impurities such that the water is suitable for internal re-use in an operating phosphoric acid facility or release. Additionally, the process is able to treat acidic industrial waste water by the removal of impurities as a preliminary treatment stage leading to discharge of the final treated water to natural water bodies in compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act. Moreover, treated water may be processed by reverse osmosis to remove residual impurities.

The warmed actively digesting sludge is pumped from the slipstream loop through a rock trap into a delivery/input loop both for aiding transport or delivery of FOG waste to, and for partially filing a closed receiving/conditioning holding tank, where the warmed actively digesting sludge softens and liquefies the FOG wastes offloaded into the holding tank for further treatment at a desired treatment temperature range (whether psychrophilic, mesophilic, or thermophilic). The contents of the closed receiving/conditioning holding tank are continuously mixed by a bottom-top recirculation chopper pump to pre-treat the FOG wastes, liquefying and decreasing solids particle size allowing acidogens in the actively digesting sludge to pre-digest such wastes producing volatile fatty acids, some biogas and a highly bioreactive, flowable feedstock slurry. The produced highly bioreactive, flowable feedstock slurry can then injected back into the actively digesting sludge slipstream loop at a controlled rate where the resultant mixture then is introduced, together with raw sewage or other digestible wastes, into input or head ends of waste treatment systems having anaerobic digesters for digestion of solids and steady-state methane production. Advantages of the integrated system relate to a partial digestion of the FOG in the reaction/holding tank generating volatile fatty acids that suppress expression of methane producing methagens in the holding tank, increased steady-state methane production and significantly reduced solids volume of treated digestible wastes (sewage) and FOG wastes.","1.

US,US,P,A1,Integrated water decontamination plant and well pump arrangement,"The present invention removes contaminants from well water without creating the problem of large volumes of waste liquid disposal. It uses double-cone devices (102, 116, 125) as pressure amplifiers which due to their lack of moving parts avoid the risk of additional contamination of the well and provide a prolonged lifetime.

US,US,P,B1,Phosphate mineral-based reactive barrier containment system,"A phosphate mineral based reactive barrier system. Phosphate minerals are known to be sinks for heavy metal contaminants. The reactive barrier prevents the release of contaminants from waste materials, sediments or dredged materials via reaction with the contaminants at the interface between the barrier and the waste material, sediments or dredged material. The barrier is comprised of a phosphate mineral material where the form of the phosphate mineral is variable but primarily insoluble. This barrier is placed below, around, and/or on top of the contaminated materials such that the contaminated materials are completely enveloped, capped, or contained by a grout curtain. The barrier can be in a (i) slurry form, (ii) blended matrix form with other inorganic agents, or (iii) composite form with a geotextile or geofabric. These methods of construction can be used singly or jointly. In some cases, pH control may be used to optimize the chemical reactions within the barrier system. The barrier mechanism relies on the phenomena of adsorption, surface precipitation and co-precipitation of metal phosphate surface precipitates to chemically retard diffusion from the waste material. Immobilization may also occur secondarily when a small percentage of the phosphate minerals partially dissolve and the phosphate precipitates with metals to form metal phosphate precipitates in the pore water system of the reactive barrier. The contaminated wastes, sediments or dredged materials may have been subjected to solidification or chemical stabilization or other forms of treatment prior to disposal.","1.

US,US,P,A ,Pre-thickened aerobic digester system,"An aerobic treatment process is operated to reduce overall oxygen requirements, to maintain general pH balance and to produce a low-coliform solids effluent. From the system's clarifier a slurry of concentrated solids is moved to a premix basin, where the slurry is vigorously aerated for a sufficient time to raise microbial activity and dissolved oxygen content. The aerated, microbially active sludge is then moved to a gravity thickener basin, in which solids are allowed to settle to the bottom without aeration, to establish a quiescent state in the settled sludge and also an anoxic stage. This causes the sludge to be denitrified by microbial action, raising and stabilizing the pH of the sludge. Separated supernatant liquid is decanted and removed from the gravity thickener. The sludge is moved into an aerobic digester, where the sludge is aerated and nitrification occurs but using less aeration than normally required in a digester, due to the effect of anoxic/aerobic phases. A portion of the slurry in the aerobic digester basin is recycled back to the premix basin. Another important aspect is the use of two digesters, only one in loop with the premix and thickener at any one time, with each digester being taken out of the loop and isolated when a solids content of about 25,000 to 35,000 mg/L (21/2% to 3.5%) is achieved in that digester.

US,US,P,A1,SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT,"Waste water conditioning has nearly 150 years of history. During this time, a method has developed that is considered to be state of the art. While this method meets the requirements at hand, it is complicated and expensive. The novel method breaks down the rigidly entrenched method and simplifies it. In a plurality of stages, the only energy that is used is gravity, which is readily available and free of cost. Thus, an “alternative sewage treatment plant” has been developed, which has a simpler method and is less expensive in terms of investment costs and operating costs, at the same capacity, and requires only a fraction of the previous required surface area. The most important characteristic of the invention is that the novel method separates solids from waste water immediately after entering the sewage treatment plant. Mechanically purified water is much faster, easier and less expensive to purify. The paths pursued for conditioning of the sludge are also new. The sludge is regarded as an energy source or recyclable material, which should be utilized accordingly. According to the invention, the prerequisite for utilizing the sludge is also created by economically drying it to 95 to 98% dry substance.","1.

US,US,P,A1,"Density adjustment by the use of light cycle oil, (LCO), for recovery and reclamation of spilled oil following the 2010 off-shore leak in the Gulf","Our idea is a new procedure that can be used to clean up and recover oil from spills or oil leaking from damaged ships or rigs. The reclamation is accomplished by restoring the oil's light density. This is accomplished with density control by adding light cycle oil, (LCO), with a density of 0.82 g/ml, to the oil being recovered for the purpose of reprocessing in refineries. Recovery is made possible through the application of solubility rules found in organic chemistry. LCO is a mixture of many different molecular weight hydrocarbons that have many different numbers of carbons in their chains, branches, or rings. Each of these hydrocarbons dissolves a small part of the oil preparing the mixture for collection and reprocessing as refinery feedstock. Furthermore, this idea can prevent the need for landfill storage and offset the cost of recovery.","1. Claim # 2 for application Ser. No. 12/803,127. I have developed a method to clean up and recover any gulf oil spills using the following steps. 1. Adjust the density of spilled oil by adding light cycle oil (LCO) to reduce the density below 0.96 g/ml on a densitometer.2. Collect the adjusted oil, including tar balls, in a shipping container.3. Drain the separated water layer which contains only 1.5 to 2.5 ppm oil.4. Transfer and sell the collected mixed oil to a refinery to be used as feedstock to reduce the cost of recovery.5. Save the recovered LCO for reuse because the wide range of organic compounds in LCO allows solubility of all oil components.",1,12/803127,2010-06-18,2011-0309028,2011-12-22,,,,,0,,,,,Guy Adelle Pinson | Barbara Pinson,,,,,,,,C02F-001/24,C02F-001/24,210/705,210/705,,,,5.41105E+12

Such systems draw blood at such a high rate that a loss of integrity in the blood circuit can be catastrophic. The most reliable leak detection method known is the detection of infiltrated air in a blood line, but this only works in blood lines under negative pressure. According to the invention, a leak detector for return lines is provided by periodically generating a negative pressure, which may be brief or at a 50% duty cycle, in the blood return line to draw air into it and thereby reveal the leaks using an air sensor. Although the return line is ordinarily under positive pressure, during the negative pressure cycle, the blood return line draws air through any leaks or disconnects. If air is detected, the system is shut down and an alarm generated. ","1.

The reclamation is accomplished by restoring the oil's light density. This is accomplished with density control by adding light cycle oil, (LCO), with a density of 0.82 g/ml, to the oil being recovered for the purpose of reprocessing in refineries. Recovery is made possible through the application of solubility rules found in organic chemistry. LCO is a mixture of many different molecular weight hydrocarbons that have many different numbers of carbons in their chains, branches, or rings. Each of these hydrocarbons dissolves a small part of the oil preparing the mixture for collection and reprocessing as refinery feedstock. Furthermore, this idea can prevent the need for landfill storage and offset the cost of recovery.","1. Claim # 2 for application Ser. No. 12/803,127.

US,US,P,A1,Water treatment/remediation system,"[none] A treatment system passes feed water containing a contaminant such as perchlorate through a bed of strong base anion exchange resin that has been placed in a form (e.g., in sulfate form) to selectively capture the contaminant while passing other ions (e.g., nitrate) that may also be present in the water. The bed selectively removes the perchlorate with high efficiency, for example on a stoichiometric basis, until exhaustion. The bed operates robustly without spiking or displacement of more weakly-held or lower affinity ions as composition of the feed varies. The water may be further treated, if necessary, to produce a purified or potable product, in which case downstream processes may remove remaining contaminants and co-ions. Alternatively, the treated stream may be returned to or blended with the source to effect contaminant remediation, e.g., site clean-up. Contaminants such as uranium species, perchlorate or pertechnate may be treated by this method using ordinary (non-specialty) exchange resins. The bed may include a carousel, and the exhausted upstream portion of the resin may efficiently be disposed of by incineration, or may be rotated out for regeneration. Alternatively, the bed or the spent portion thereof may be periodically regenerated transferring perchlorate to a regeneration fluid waste. The concentrated waste may be disposed of by incineration, bioreaction or other suitable disposal process. The concentrated regen waste may also be passed through a smaller, sacrificial bed of ion exchange resin to capture its perchlorate, allowing re-use of the regen fluid and forming a lower-volume solid waste output.

However, the high-temperature burning system is not satisfactorily improved due to various problems such as a difficulty of control for a furnace, a problem of disposing the ash containing non-decomposed PCB, a problem of generation of dioxin in lower processing temperature, a problem of movement of the PCB and a problem of not obtaining the agreement of inhabitants. Moreover, the chemical decomposing system raises various other problems in that a plant must be constructed with a huge investment that is said to be equal to 40 hundred millions per plant, that PCB must be transported to the PCB disposing plant and that the PCB disposing speed in the plan is too slow. The present invention provides a novel PCB electrolyzing and disposing method and apparatus based on a new idea in which the PCB used as electrically insulating oil can be electrolyzed by passing the electricity through the PCB. The PCB disposing apparatus of the present invention may be portable. Thus, the apparatus can be moved to any PCB storage place to dispose the PCB in place without transportation of the PCB. In addition to the introduction of the PCB into an electrolyzing tank, the PCB may be electrolyzed by pouring water into the container of equipment containing the remaining PCB, inserting the inserting portion including the electric-wave rod, electrode rods and others into the water to electrolyze the PCB. A PCB-polluted container may be placed in a large-sized disposing tank for electrolysis. The system of the present invention may be used as a soil improving apparatus by placing PCB- or dioxin-polluted soil in a disposing tank and electrolyzing the PCB or dioxin therein. The apparatus of the present invention may be manufactured in smaller to larger sizes, depending on processing scale, and may be manufactured as a portable apparatus, as a large-scaled plant or as an integral unit mounted on a vehicle. Moreover, the system of the present invention can dispose the PCB with a greatly reduced cost and in an increased speed, in comparison with the prior art. According to the present invention, the disposal of PCB can be sharply be accelerated in Japan and the world. ","1.

All that is needed is intimate contact between the fish bones and fish hard parts and the contaminated waste form, soil particles, or water. In a system of, for example, soil, waste, groundwater, surface water, waste streams, or the digestive tracts of animals, the presence of fish bones and fish hard parts reduces the amount of metal that can mobilize and migrate out of the system. Fish bones and fish hard parts remove metals from waters passing through the system or originating within the system. Fish bones and fish hard parts reduce the bioavailability of metals to organisms coming into contact with the system and from water leaving the system.

US,US,P,A ,Pre-thickened aerobic digester system,"An aerobic treatment process is operated to reduce overall oxygen requirements, to maintain general pH balance and to produce a low-coliform solids effluent. From the system's clarifier a slurry of concentrated solids is moved to a premix basin, where the slurry is vigorously aerated for a sufficient time to raise microbial activity and dissolved oxygen content. The aerated, microbially active sludge is then moved to a gravity thickener basin, in which solids are allowed to settle to the bottom without aeration, to establish a quiescent state in the settled sludge and also an anoxic stage. This causes the sludge to be denitrified by microbial action, raising and stabilizing the pH of the sludge. Separated supernatant liquid is decanted and removed from the gravity thickener. The sludge is moved into an aerobic digester, where the sludge is aerated and nitrification occurs but using less aeration than normally required in a digester, due to the effect of anoxic/aerobic phases. A portion of the slurry in the aerobic digester basin is recycled back to the premix basin. Another important aspect is the use of two digesters, only one in loop with the premix and thickener at any one time, with each digester being taken out of the loop and isolated when a solids content of about 25,000 to 35,000 mg/L (21/2% to 3.5%) is achieved in that digester.

The leakage of oil at such depth in sea is hard to assess. In such cases controlling and collection of the spill is the first thing to do. The Espriz Funnel system is based on simple and logical principles and the operation is low cost and fast.

The loaded fuel may be accompanied by sea water and separating is easy to do. By this method the contact between the leaked oil and the sea water will be reduced to minimum possible and practically the whole leaked oil will be collected, without contaminating the sea water.

US,US,P,A1,Automated marine container terminal and system,"A system, equipment, and processes for extending the scope of automation in port container facilities, and thereby increasing port capacity within fixed land resources, increasing operational productivity, increasing safety, increasing the velocity and reliability of goods movement, increasing freight security, reducing negative environmental impacts, and reducing the overall cost of goods movement. A storage area is accessed by automated guided vehicles which receive and unload containerized loads. On the waterside, loads are exchanged between the vehicles and ships using quay cranes. On the ground transportation side, loads are exchanged between the vehicles and truck or rail carriers using semi automated or automated remote-controlled bridge cranes. Within the storage area, loads are exchanged between the vehicles and the storage facilities using automated stacking cranes. The vehicles are adapted to receive a cassette storage platform which in turn receives standard ISO containers. The vehicles also are adapted to receive one or more alternative platforms including a coning platform for workers to manage container coning, a reefer access and maintenance platform, and a worker transport platform. The use of a single vehicle type with interchangeable platforms allows for maximum flexibility and efficiency. The automation of the vehicle allows for complete contamination within the storage portion of the system. The system thus substantially extends the reach of automation to cover both landside and waterside intra-terminal transfer operations. By this extension, the interface of workers and machines is greatly reduced, increasing safety, productivity, security, and capacity. By this extension, the robotic control process can be fully optimized, increasing velocity and reliability while reducing the terminal's environmental footprint.","1.

In general, the present invention relates to anti-fouling systems as are known to prevent biological growth such as algae, seaweed and crustacea on marine vessels or underwater structures. Coating materials have been developed preventing corrosion due to oxidation of the surface of the structure. Although such materials have effects of retarding growth of the corrosion, however, they contain zinc, lead, copper, etc, raising a problem of environmental pollution due to dissolution of these metals into seawater. In addition, none of these coating materials can prevent clinging of marine organisms, and if they cling to the structure, oxidation is accelerated by oxygen sent out from the marine organisms, causing further growth of the corrosion of the structure. The formation of encrustations of barnacles, tunicates, and like fouling organisms, will increase the vessel's weight, thereby decreasing the available storage space, slow a vessel underway, increase its fuel consumption, and make it difficult to handle, thus reducing the vessel's performance and efficiency. The present invention addresses this need wherein the transducer is operable on a cyclic basis.","1.

US,US,P,A1,LOW-DRAG HYDRODYNAMIC SURFACES,"The invention relates to the use of gas cavities to reduce frictional drag on underwater surfaces such as hydrofoils, struts, fins, rudders, keels, propeller blades, ship hulls, underwater bodies, and wetted surfaces in general. Each gas-filled cavity is formed behind a discontinuity in the surface that causes the water boundary layer to separate from the surface. Gas is ejected into a region behind the discontinuity to fill the cavity; the gas can be air. If a cavity is open to the atmosphere, then air can typically fill the cavity naturally without air ejection. Cavities can either be closed or open. A low drag hydrofoil may have a closed cavity on one side, and an open cavity on the other side. For closed cavities, the underlying surface can be shaped to minimize cavity closure drag. Various ways to generate cavities, change hydrodynamic forces, and duct gas internally on hydrofoils and struts with cavities are covered. Different designs of hydrofoil boats, hydrofoil ships and ship hulls that are amenable to drag reduction are presented. ","1.

US,US,P,A1,"Anchor for vehicle, vehicle and anchor in combination, and method of using the anchor","A seabed anchor (20) is fixed to and deployable from an ROV (10) for positively anchoring the ROV (10) to the seabed (100). The seabed anchor (20) comprises three nested telescoping tubes (26, 28, & 30). The upper end of the outermost tube (26) is fixed to the ROV (10). A rotary drill bit (38) is carried on the output shaft of a motor (34) that is mounted on the lower end of the innermost tube (30). The nested assembly of three telescopic tubes (26, 28, 30) can be controllably extended and retracted by controlled operation of a hydraulic ram or other linear actuator coupled between the outer tube (26) and the inner tube (30). Each of the tubes (26, 28 & 30) carries a respective one or two pairs of inflatable packets (40, 42, & 44) that are normally uninflated and lie quiescent within respective recesses in the sides of the tubes where the packers do not interfere with telescopic relative movements of the tubes. To set the seabed anchor (20), the drill bit (38) is rotated and forced downwards into the seabed (100) to form a bore. When the bore is at its full depth, the packers (40, 42, & 44) are inflated to force the packers into penetrating engagement with the seabed (100) surrounding the bore, thereby anchoring the ROV (10) to the seabed (100). The seabed anchor (20) allows the ROV (10) to be firmly anchored onto the seabed (100) to resist upward reaction forces arising from ROV-carried geotechnical tools and/or sensors (e.g. a soil sampling tool) being made to penetrate the seabed (100).

The reclamation is accomplished by restoring the oil's light density. This is accomplished with density control by adding light cycle oil, (LCO), with a density of 0.82 g/ml, to the oil being recovered for the purpose of reprocessing in refineries. Recovery is made possible through the application of solubility rules found in organic chemistry. LCO is a mixture of many different molecular weight hydrocarbons that have many different numbers of carbons in their chains, branches, or rings. Each of these hydrocarbons dissolves a small part of the oil preparing the mixture for collection and reprocessing as refinery feedstock.

This turbulent flow develops a significant amount of interfacial surface area between the gas and the process fluid resulting in a reduction of the required residence time of the gas within the process fluid to achieve thermal equilibrium and/or to drive chemical reactions to completion, all of which leads to a more efficient and complete evaporation, chemical reaction, or combined evaporation and chemical reaction process.","1.

The method involves providing the landfill with an upper gas containment layer near the surface of the landfill to retard biogas escape and air entrainment into the landfill. Underneath the gas containment layer is provided a gas-permeable conductive layer. Underneath the conductive layer, a well withdraws biogas from the landfill. Withdrawal of biogas from the well creates a partial vacuum that draws gas from the gas-permeable conductive layer down through the waste mass to the well. If the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too rapid, air will be entrained from the atmosphere into the gas-permeable conductive layer. But if the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too slow, biogas may percolate through the gas-containment layer and the surface of the landfill to escape. Monitoring the gas composition of the gas-permeable layer allows one to determine quickly and continuously whether the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too fast or too slow.","1.

US,US,P,A1,Integrated water decontamination plant and well pump arrangement,"The present invention removes contaminants from well water without creating the problem of large volumes of waste liquid disposal. It uses double-cone devices (102, 116, 125) as pressure amplifiers which due to their lack of moving parts avoid the risk of additional contamination of the well and provide a prolonged lifetime.

US,US,P,A1,Landfill design and method for improved landfill gas capture,"The invention provides an improved method of collecting biogas from a landfill that results in more complete collection of biogas produced in the landfill, and with less contamination with air. The method involves providing the landfill with an upper gas containment layer near the surface of the landfill to retard biogas escape and air entrainment into the landfill. Underneath the gas containment layer is provided a gas-permeable conductive layer. Underneath the conductive layer, a well withdraws biogas from the landfill. Withdrawal of biogas from the well creates a partial vacuum that draws gas from the gas-permeable conductive layer down through the waste mass to the well.

US,US,P,A1,Water treatment/remediation system,"[none] A treatment system passes feed water containing a contaminant such as perchlorate through a bed of strong base anion exchange resin that has been placed in a form (e.g., in sulfate form) to selectively capture the contaminant while passing other ions (e.g., nitrate) that may also be present in the water. The bed selectively removes the perchlorate with high efficiency, for example on a stoichiometric basis, until exhaustion. The bed operates robustly without spiking or displacement of more weakly-held or lower affinity ions as composition of the feed varies. The water may be further treated, if necessary, to produce a purified or potable product, in which case downstream processes may remove remaining contaminants and co-ions. Alternatively, the treated stream may be returned to or blended with the source to effect contaminant remediation, e.g., site clean-up. Contaminants such as uranium species, perchlorate or pertechnate may be treated by this method using ordinary (non-specialty) exchange resins. The bed may include a carousel, and the exhausted upstream portion of the resin may efficiently be disposed of by incineration, or may be rotated out for regeneration. Alternatively, the bed or the spent portion thereof may be periodically regenerated transferring perchlorate to a regeneration fluid waste. The concentrated waste may be disposed of by incineration, bioreaction or other suitable disposal process. The concentrated regen waste may also be passed through a smaller, sacrificial bed of ion exchange resin to capture its perchlorate, allowing re-use of the regen fluid and forming a lower-volume solid waste output. This second-bed re-transfer process operates efficiently at the high concentration present in spent regen fluid, and requires only a small fraction of the original bed volume. ","1.

US,US,P,A1,Pcb treating device and pcb treating method by electrolysis,"Toxic PCB has been broadly used as insulating oil in electric equipment such as capacitors, transformers and the like. Since the PCB is a refractory organic compound, the disposal of PCB is not advanced until now. This is a great social problem in Japan and the world. Thus, the early disposal of PCB is demanded. The conventional PCB disposing systems include a burnout type high-temperature disposing system and a chemical decomposing system. However, the high-temperature burning system is not satisfactorily improved due to various problems such as a difficulty of control for a furnace, a problem of disposing the ash containing non-decomposed PCB, a problem of generation of dioxin in lower processing temperature, a problem of movement of the PCB and a problem of not obtaining the agreement of inhabitants. Moreover, the chemical decomposing system raises various other problems in that a plant must be constructed with a huge investment that is said to be equal to 40 hundred millions per plant, that PCB must be transported to the PCB disposing plant and that the PCB disposing speed in the plan is too slow.

US,US,P,B1,Phosphate mineral-based reactive barrier containment system,"A phosphate mineral based reactive barrier system. Phosphate minerals are known to be sinks for heavy metal contaminants. The reactive barrier prevents the release of contaminants from waste materials, sediments or dredged materials via reaction with the contaminants at the interface between the barrier and the waste material, sediments or dredged material. The barrier is comprised of a phosphate mineral material where the form of the phosphate mineral is variable but primarily insoluble. This barrier is placed below, around, and/or on top of the contaminated materials such that the contaminated materials are completely enveloped, capped, or contained by a grout curtain. The barrier can be in a (i) slurry form, (ii) blended matrix form with other inorganic agents, or (iii) composite form with a geotextile or geofabric. These methods of construction can be used singly or jointly. In some cases, pH control may be used to optimize the chemical reactions within the barrier system. The barrier mechanism relies on the phenomena of adsorption, surface precipitation and co-precipitation of metal phosphate surface precipitates to chemically retard diffusion from the waste material. Immobilization may also occur secondarily when a small percentage of the phosphate minerals partially dissolve and the phosphate precipitates with metals to form metal phosphate precipitates in the pore water system of the reactive barrier. The contaminated wastes, sediments or dredged materials may have been subjected to solidification or chemical stabilization or other forms of treatment prior to disposal.","1.

A floating check valve is connected to each of the drain pipes to regulate the flow of water through the drain pipe. The floating check valve includes a valve element that has a density which causes the valve element to float in water and sink in oil. Therefore, when the valve element is surrounded by oil, the drain pipe will close and impede the passage of oil through the drain pipe.

US,US,P,A ,Pre-thickened aerobic digester system,"An aerobic treatment process is operated to reduce overall oxygen requirements, to maintain general pH balance and to produce a low-coliform solids effluent. From the system's clarifier a slurry of concentrated solids is moved to a premix basin, where the slurry is vigorously aerated for a sufficient time to raise microbial activity and dissolved oxygen content. The aerated, microbially active sludge is then moved to a gravity thickener basin, in which solids are allowed to settle to the bottom without aeration, to establish a quiescent state in the settled sludge and also an anoxic stage. This causes the sludge to be denitrified by microbial action, raising and stabilizing the pH of the sludge. Separated supernatant liquid is decanted and removed from the gravity thickener. The sludge is moved into an aerobic digester, where the sludge is aerated and nitrification occurs but using less aeration than normally required in a digester, due to the effect of anoxic/aerobic phases. A portion of the slurry in the aerobic digester basin is recycled back to the premix basin. Another important aspect is the use of two digesters, only one in loop with the premix and thickener at any one time, with each digester being taken out of the loop and isolated when a solids content of about 25,000 to 35,000 mg/L (21/2% to 3.5%) is achieved in that digester.
